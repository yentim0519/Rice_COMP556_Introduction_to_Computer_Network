Our Tests:
We ping a message with different size of messages and the server will successfully pong back the message we send, which is only
a lot of char a in this case.

Problems:
When mulitple clients are sending messages to the server, the server will stuck and won't receive anything to our clients and 
cause our clients stuck too.
