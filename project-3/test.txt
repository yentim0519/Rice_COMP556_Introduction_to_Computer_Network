We developed 5 configurations named inclassTest1, inclassTest2, changeDelayTest, poisonReverseTest and largeGraphTest to test our implementation.
The inclassTest1 and inclassTest2 are based on the examples provided in the lectures. The changeDelay is used to test whether the program could handle changedelay properly.
The poisonReverseTest is intended for testing if the poison reverse could function correctly. Lastly, the largeGraphTest is a complex topologies with linkcomingup, linkdying and changedelay events.
The files of these configurations could be found in the folder.

Since events that are at the exact same time can be simulated in any order, instead of checking the output row by row,
we obeserve the forwarding table in each router after the protocal is stabilized to see whether those tables are reasonable.
